This thesis proposes a hop-by-hop capacity estimation methodology  with active probing.

We use the passive capacity measurement tool PPrate, which is based packet-pair technique and is used for end-to-end capacity estimations.

We have developed a traffic generation tool with adjustable Time-To-Live values, which enables us to generate traffic to each router on the network path one by one and take advantage of the ICMP messages received back at the host.

We further process the received time-exceeded ICMP messages, derive inter-arrival times from this data and estimate capacities of each hop with PPrate using these inter-arrival times.

Subsequently we evaluate the methodology in empty networks without any flow interference, which shows good results in most of the cases.

Then we conduct experiments in a busy path congested with cross-traffic.

Our technique, along with desired results, has shown some significant flaws too.
